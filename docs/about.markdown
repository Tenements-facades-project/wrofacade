# About the project

Wrocław (a city in Poland) is full of historic tenements. They are built in
a variety of architectural styles, like Modernism or Neoclassicism.

When walking through Wrocław, one can find some free spaces between tenements (they
appear as a result of demolishing an old building, for example).
As such gaps do not fit to the landscape of the historic city centre,
it would be beneficial to design a bulding that would fit in.

The task of designing a facade of a tenement to fill such gaps in the historic city
centre usually posseses a major challenge. This is due to a plenty of conditions
the project must satisfy in order to follow the highest architectural standards while
being accepted by local authorities. The most obvious limit for an architect designing
the facade are dimensions of the gap to place the tenement in. What is more,
there are land development plans that provide guidelines an architect is obliged
to follow (e.g. number of floors). And the crucial aspect is the architectural style
compliance with neighboring buildings (or a style chosen by the architect).

The goal of the Wrofacade project is to build an application that
would help an architect come up with the best concept of a facade by generating
a big number of possible solutions with generative AI. The model should be
capable of taking into account provided requirements on the output.
